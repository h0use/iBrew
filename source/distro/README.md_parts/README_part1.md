# iBrew: The Dream Tea!

iKettle, [iKettle 2.0](http://smarter.am/ikettle) and [Smarter Coffee](http://smarter.am/coffee) Interface


> “The only way to get any smarter is to play a smarter opponent.”

Comming soon the iKettle emulator and the iKettle 2.0 emulator! 

## Needed remote access to iKettle 1, to test new code!

To test and finish: 
  * iKettle Emulation (emulates an iKettle with an iKettle 2.0)
  * iKettle Brigde (connect to an iKettle and use it if it was an iKettle 2.0)
  * Figure out to correct responses
  
Such that all features of iBrew are available (if supported) for the original iKettle!

So if you have an original iKettle filled up with water! And some time to spare!


## Needed help with Website layout! CSS!
Were talking about CSS for tablet, phones and displays... *ugh*.

### iBrew in the Media
[The iKettle, the Eleven-Hour Struggle to Make a Cup of Tea, and Why It Was All About Data, Analytics and Connecting Things Together](https://medium.com/mark-rittman/the-story-behind-the-ikettle-the-eleven-hour-struggle-to-make-a-cup-of-tea-and-why-it-was-all-769144d12d7#.h62foolse) 


### Old :-) News
I would like to thank Ju4ia for letting me access his coffee machine remotely, and get more Smarter Coffee missing protocol bits, and... that I could test the client code. And all the other people helping track down bugs and supplying new features, whether by e-mail or in the issues, Thanks!

Since the console it nearly done, protocol almost fully mapped out. It is time to focus on the webpage... the framework is working, it auto reconnect, keeps some stats and you can even preform some actions with it.

## Installing

### Source

You can run iBrew on systems that run python 2.7. Download and unpack the [source](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/archive/master.zip), download it from github using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or manually `git clone https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew.git`. Finish the setup with running `make setup` in the iBrew folder to configure the python packages for bare bones operation. Update to the latest version of iBrew with `git pull`. Run `make` to see all other options possible.

### Windows 

  * [Windows x86](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12474226/32/iBrew.exe)
  * [Windows x64](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12474226/64/iBrew.exe)

#### From source
First no python is installed by default so head up over to [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install v2.7 (NOT 3)
Secondly you need [make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), make sure you copy make.exe and its dll's to c:\windows or add it to your command path. The python [win32 package](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or [git for xp](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.10.0.windows.1) and your machine should be minial XP SP3.

For creating a package we need [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download), the [PythonVC] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266) or any other [compilers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) compatible. For XP install .NET 3.5 and use [Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5
](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24826) as a compiler. And after installing a compiler run `make pyinstallerwin`

Edit [ibrewui](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/blob/master/source/ibrewui#L100) with the Python IDLE editor and uncomment the pass and comment the out the following 3 lines

```
pass
#from iBrewMac import MacGui
#                self.ui = MacGui(self.web)
#                self.ui.run()
```                
                
Go into the source folder and use `make setupwin` to setup, use `make win` to create a package and use `make cleanwin` to clean up

### MacOS
  * [MacOS](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12474226/64/iBrew.dmg)

By default, make sure that you give access in system preferences, security & privacy! The app is NOT signed and will NOT run until you give permission.

Once you start the app from the MacOS package (drag it to your application folder first) it will auto link iBrew in your terminal (due to a bug, this only works if you have brew installed, please run `sudo ln -s /Applications/iBrew.app/Contents/MacOS/iBrewConsole /usr/local/bin/ibrew`).
Open a terminal and run ```ibrew``` and you're all set, good to go!

_it creates a soft symlink to /usr/local/bin/ibrew,... :-)_

#### From source
Make sure either the command line or xcode is installed, just run `make` in the source folder and it will prompt for a download!
Go into the source folder and, use `make setupmac` to setup, use `make mac` to create a package and use `make cleanmac` to clean up. For a package you need to have patched pyinstaller, install it from source use `make pyinstallermac`

### Linux

See Pi section.

Go into the source folder and, use `make setuplin` to setup, use `make lin` to create a package and use `make cleanlin` to clean up. For a package you need to have the pyinstaller >= 3.3 so install it from source use `make pyinstallerlin`

#### Bonjour

Bonjour is not enabled by default, to install it use `make bonjourlin`, `make bonjourmac` or for windows `make bonjourwin`. But you have to have bonjour installed on your system, macOS its out of the box, on most linux system you can install it with (or try equivalent packages for your *nix distro) `apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-discover libnss-mdns` and on Windows you either install iTunes or download it from [apple](http://developer.apple.com/networking/bonjour/download/). Also check out [pybonjour](https://code.google.com/archive/p/pybonjour/)

### Raspberry Pi Jessy (light)

Tested on a clean Jessy light image (september 2016). 

#### Install 

SSH to the Pi! And use:

```
cd ~
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
git clone https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew.git
cd ~/iBrew/source
sudo make setuplin
sudo ln -s ~/iBrew/ibrew /usr/local/bin/ibrew
```

Now you can start ibrew from anywhere :-) Type in your terminal

```
ibrew
```

Or if you want to start the web interface with event triggers type 

```
ibrew events web
```

And surf to your pi on port 2080!

#### Update 

You can update to the latest version of iBrew with

```
cd ~/iBrew
git pull
```

#### Start web server on pi boot

To add the webserver on boot run

```
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/iBrew.service
```

Copy and paste this text and save with ctrl-x

```
[Unit]
Description=iBrew
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/iBrew/ibrew events web
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then run the additional commands
```
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/iBrew.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable iBrew.service
sudo systemctl start iBrew.service
sudo systemctl status iBrew.service
```

#### Troubleshooting

Please post any bug or [issues](https://github.com/Tristan79/iBrew/issues) here on github!
The error handling is still kinda broken... :-) now use dump to see more. Will revert to debug, info, logging (wip)

### Log & config location

### Unable to connect to iKettle 2.0 or Smarter Coffee appliance

```
MoonTwo:iBrew Tristan$ ./ibrew list
[10.0.0.3:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found iKettle 2.0 (iBrew certified firmware v19)
[10.0.0.98:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found Smarter Coffee (iBrew certified firmware v20)
[10.0.0.99:2016-11-13 12:38:24] Found iKettle 2.0 (iBrew certified firmware v19)
```
Some hints
* Did you download, clone or pull iBrew from git to get the latest version with all the bug fixes?

Network trouble
 * Does the Smarter app autodetects it?
 * Is a firewall blocking port 2081 on your computer (or on your router)?
 * Does ```./ibrew list``` work?
 * Make sure that your kettle/coffee machine is on the same network and subnet as your pc and your phone.
 * It could be that your router is blocking utp broadcast messages (some do, so it never auto detects). 
 * Running it on a computer with only a loopback device will result in auto detection be disabled (when using the simulator)

Static IP address
 * Look up the IP address of the appliance in your router (dhpc server)
 * Set up a static IP address in your router (dhpc server) for your appliance

Reset wireless network
 * Reset appliance (iKettle is longer then 10 seconds button hold on base, coffee machine, eeuh I forgot which button but you can use the smarter app to reset your appliance wireless network to direct mode [FIX])
 * If the appliance is reset. Try connect with your wifi of your pc (if it has wifi) to the appliance its wireless network access point iKettle:?? or SmarterCoffee:?? try if iBrew works.
 * Reconnect to your wifi network (and if you are lucky and could connect with iBrew in direct mode, the command is ./ibrew join namewireless password) else use your phone app.
